I'm a founder and developer of the FoodMap project aiming to aggregate the small food sellers on a map of web-app and to equip it with searching and ordering engines. At the current stage of the project, I'm interested in networking and finding stakeholders who might be interested in promoting the app and have the opportunity to launch a customer development process in their region/country. The range of stakeholders is determined by the main features included in the app:
1.  Easy-in-use online shop builder can be interesting for small food retailers wishing to expose a range of food and beverage to consumers online (there is an example of the app use case for wineries in Santa Rosa, CA - https://bit.ly/3j8C8dj ) and multi-language support allows sellers to offer foodstuff in different languages for the convenience of foreign travelers.
2. The builder of independent local delivery service may be in demand by those who want to launch a self-organized delivery service in their area;
3. A location-based food searching engine could be used by the food producers or the state agencies (NFA-e.g.) for the food market monitoring;
4. Audio-video streaming service helps to connect buyers with the seller for online presentation and remote discussion of terms of sale.

As I'm planning to join the Data Food Consortium (https://www.datafoodconsortium.org/en/) I would be happy to meet people who can represent Georgia in the consortium for our common actions.
